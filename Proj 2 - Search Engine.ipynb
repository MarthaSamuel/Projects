For any input query, we’ll present the five  most relevant news articles. \n","\n","\n","Problem Statement: \n","\n","Reuters Ltd. is an international news agency headquartered in London and is a division of Thomson Reuters. The data was originally collected and labeled by Carnegie Group Inc. and Reuters Ltd. in the course of developing the construe text categorization system. \n","\n","\n","An important step before assessing similarity between documents, or between documents and a search query, is the right representation i.e., correct feature engineering. We’ll make a process that provides the most similar news articles to a given text string (search query).\n","\n","\n","Domain: News\n","\n","\n","Analysis to be done: Document similarity assessment to a search query using Tf-Idf\n","\n","\n","Steps to perform:\t\n","\n","Organizing or retrieving news is a big problem statement for any news agency, or any site that publishes news. The two major applications of measuring similarity between texts are news article retrieval for a given query and assessing similarity between any two documents.\n","\n","\n","We will use TF-IDF representation of the text after clean up (stop word removal, case normalization, lemmatization). With the Tf-Idf representation, we will use Cosine similarity as a measure of similarity between an article and a query/article.\n","\n","\n","Tasks:- \n","\n","Using Pandas, read in the text file.\n","\n","Use the right delimiter, read the file using read_csv function from pandas package.\n","\n","The file has no header. While loading, give column names as label and  text.\n","\n","Get the article text into a list, for easy text cleanup and manipulation.\n","\n","Normalize the case by converting all texts into lowercase and assigning new variables.\n","\n","Tokenize the articles.\n","\n","Use NLTKs word_tokenize for to tokenize the articles. \n","\n","Check out the top three articles after tokenizing.\n","\n","Remove stop words from the data.\n","\n","Use stop words present in the NLTK.\n","\n","Define a function del_stop that takes in a tokenized sentence and returns the terms without the stop words.\n","\n","Then, apply this function and remove stop words from all the articles.\n","\n","Feature Engineering: Use TF-IDF to represent each document.\n","\n","Instantiate TF-IDF vectorizer with 3000 vocabulary size\n","\n","The vectorizer needs the strings, not vectors. Join the tokens into the string for each article\n","\n","Apply TF-IDF vectorization on the articles and  determine the shape of the matrix.\n","\n","Convert it to dense matrix:  The output is currently a sparse matrix, convert it to a dense matrix for ease of access.\n","\n","In this representation, we can now compute the similarity between any two articles which are now vectors.\n","\n","Calculate cosine similarity between fourth and fifth  articles (index three  and four)\n","\n","What score do you get? Does it make sense? (you’ll need to look at the strings to assess).\n","\n","Search engine: Find the five  most relevant articles for any given query, fetch the text against them. Define a function that does the following: \n","\n","For any given input string, get the TF-IDF vector.\n","\n","Compute similarity between  this vector and  all the others.\n","\n","Get indices of the top five  matches. (use whatever data structures you wish)\n","\n","Print query string.\n","\n","Return the text and the rounded cosine similarity score for the top five  matches\n","\n","Test your search engine, get top five results for the following queries:\n","\n","“crude oil price”\n","\n"," “computer systems”\n","\n","How is the performance of your search engine? Try out different queries to see how well it
